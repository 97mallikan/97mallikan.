## 🔒 Private Research Repositories  
I maintain several private repositories related to my ongoing research in **Computer Vision**, **Image Processing**, and **Deep Learning**.  
These repositories are kept private due to publication timelines, NSF project confidentiality, and active research work.

Recruiters, professors, and academic committees may **request temporary access** for evaluation.

## 📘 Featured Private Projects

### 🔹 **YOLOv8 Traffic Safety System – Private**  
Vehicle detection, tracking, danger-zone prediction, and trajectory analysis for road safety.

### 🔹 **Hazardous Object Detection for Construction Safety** 
Specializing in identifying small tools and hazardous objects within dynamic, real-world construction environments.
